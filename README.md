# SNEWS Supernova Neutrino Identification with Machine Learning
Supernova neutrinos are important. They arrive ~3 hours before visible light does from supernovae, and thus provide us with an early warning for supernova events. As supernova are rare and provide insightful spectroscopy data on high-pressure, high-energy Physics, it is ideal that we can observe as many events as possible. 

The issue stands that neutrinos, with their low mass and lack of electric charge, are extremely difficult to detect, requiring large, expensive and highly sensitive measurement systems such as Fermilab's MicroBooNE Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). Due to the LArTPC's high sensitivity, it is susceptible to noise in its images, in the form of electronic (sensors) and radiation (Argon and Radon from detector materials). 

This project is a retroactively-improved assignment from a Machine-Learning module from my BSc Physics degree. The aim is to apply Convolutional Neural Networks to successfully identify supernova neutrino events in the presence of electronic and radiological noise from simulated LArTPC data.
